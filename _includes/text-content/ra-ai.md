Our research focuses on developing novel artificial intelligence (AI) and machine learning (ML) methodologies. We specialize primarily in creating robust, interpretable AI (e.g., XAI) solutions that address complex challenges in early life health outcomes. Our work spans from theoretical frameworks to practical implementations, leveraging high-performance computing (HPC) infrastructure for large-scale health data analysis.
