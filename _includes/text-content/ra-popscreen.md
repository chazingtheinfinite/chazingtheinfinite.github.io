As a prescribed registry, BORN Ontario has the distinct capability to translate research findings into direct clinical impact. While we collaborate with external researchers for aggregate analyses and data linkages, BORN's prescribed status enables the application of our AI-driven insights at the individual level, engaging healthcare providers within the circle of care about specific risk factors and care needs.
