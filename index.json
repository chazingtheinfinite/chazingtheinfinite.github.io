With high spatial resolution, GSV has been widely adopted to study the natural environment despite its relatively low temporal resolution (i.e. limited time-series imagery available at a given location). However, vehicular-based imagery is poised to grow dramatically with the prophesied circulation of fleets of highly instrumented autonomous vehicles (AVs), producing high spatio-temporal resolution imagery of urban environments. As with GSV, leveraging these data presents the opportunity to extract information about the lived environment, while their high temporal resolution enables the study and annotation of time-varying phenomena. For example, circulating AVs will often capture location-coded images of gas stations. With a suitable CV system, one could extract the advertised numerical gas prices and automatically update crowd-sourced applications, such as GasBuddy. To this end, we assemble and release the Gas Prices of America (GPA) dataset, a large-scale, benchmark dataset of advertised gas prices from GSV imagery across the 49 mainland United States of America. Comprising 2,048 high quality annotated images, the GPA dataset enables the development and evaluation of CV models for gas price extraction from complex urban scenes. More generally, this dataset provides a challenging benchmark against which CV models can be evaluated for multi-number, multi-digit recognition tasks in the wild. For the digit-level classification task, the YOLO digit detection model trained on the Street View House Numbers dataset performed comparably to a random classifier, highlighting the difficulty of this task. Conversely, for the full-sign segmentation task, transfer learning of a DeepLabV3 ResNet101 model achieved a test F1 performance of 0.7125, following 100 epochs. Highly accurate models, when integrated with AV platforms, will represent the first opportunity to automatically update the traditionally human crowd-sourced GasBuddy dataset, heralding an era of machine-augmented crowd-sourcing.

The global propagation of the viral disease, denoted COVID-19 (‚Äúcoronavirus disease 2019‚Äù), has unified the scientific community in searching for possible inhibitory small molecules or polypeptides. Given the known interaction between the human ACE2 (‚ÄúAngiotensin-converting enzyme 2‚Äù) protein and the SARS-CoV virus (responsible for the coronavirus outbreak circa. 2003), considerable focus has been directed towards the putative interaction between the SARS-CoV-2 Spike protein and ACE2. However, a more holistic understanding of the SARS-CoV-2 vs. human inter-species interactome promises additional putative protein-protein interactions (PPI) that may be considered targets for the development of inhibitory therapeutics.\nTo that end, we leverage two state-of-the-art, sequence-based PPI predictors (PIPE4 \u0026 SPRINT) capable of generating the comprehensive SARS-CoV-2 vs. human interactome, comprising approximately 285,000 pairwise predictions. Of these, we identify the high-scoring subset of human proteins predicted to interact with each of the 14 SARS-CoV-2 proteins by both methods, comprising 279 high-confidence putative interactions involving 225 human proteins. Notably, the Spike-ACE2 interaction was the highest ranked for both the PIPE4 and SPRINT predictors, corroborating existing evidence for this PPI. Furthermore, the PIPE-Sites algorithm was used to predict the putative subsequence that might mediate each interaction and thereby inform the design of inhibitory polypeptides intended to disrupt the corresponding host-pathogen interactions.\nWe hereby publicly release the comprehensive set of PPI predictions and their corresponding PIPE-Sites landscapes in the following DataVerse repository: 10.5683/SP2/JZ77XA.

Adaptation of the PIPE3/MP-PIPE sequence preprocessing step led to upwards of 50x speedup and the new Similarity Weighted Score appropriately normalizes for window frequency when applied to any inter- and cross-species prediction schemas. Comprehensive interactomes for three prediction schemas are generated: (1) cross-species predictions, where Arabidopsis thaliana is used as a proxy to predict the comprehensive Glycine max interactome, (2) inter-species predictions between Homo sapiens-HIV1, and (3) a combined schema involving both cross- and inter-species predictions, where both Arabidopsis thaliana and Caenorhabditis elegans are used as proxy species to predict the interactome between Glycine max (the soybean legume) and Heterodera glycines (the soybean cyst nematode).

This paper intersects two unique fields‚Äîdeep learning and critical infrastructure protection‚Äîand illustrates how deep learning can improve resiliency within the electricity sector. Machine vision is the combination of machine intelligence, or computer systems automatically learning patterns from exemplar data, and image analysis, or objects of interest being automatically segmented and identified from video image data. This technology has the potential to automate threat assessments in the context of securing critical infrastructures. Rather than traditional reactionary approaches, we present here a method of leveraging deep learning for the detection of threats to critical infrastructures before failures occur. This paper discusses the state-of-the-art in deep learning for creating machine vision systems, and the concepts are applied to increase the resiliency of critical infrastructures. The intersection between machine vision and critical infrastructures is discussed, as are key benefits and challenges of invoking such an approach, and examples within several fields of critical infrastructures are presented. Automated inspection of the power infrastructure using vehicle-mounted video acquisition equipment is explored, and a proof-of-concept implementation of a deep convolutional neural network is developed, achieving 95.5% accuracy in distinguishing power-related infrastructures within images largely typical of rural settings. These preliminary results show promise in the application of deep learning and machine vision to protecting critical infrastructures through preventative maintenance.","tags":null,"title":"Deep learning for critical infrastructure resilience","type":"publication"},{"authors":["Daniel Burnside","Andrew Schoenrock","Houman Moteshareie","Mohsen Hooshyar","Prabh Basra","Maryam Hajikarimlou","Kevin Dick","Brad Barnes","Tom Kazmirchuk","Matthew Jessulat"," others"],"categories":null,"content":"","date":1548374400,"expirydate":-62135596800,"kind":"page","lang":"en","lastmod":1548374400,"objectID":"6410c4a674b81a112c3f2a0540b89364","permalink":"https://kevindick.ai/publication/burnside-2019-silico/","publishdate":"2019-01-25T00:00:00Z","relpermalink":"/publication/burnside-2019-silico/","section":"publication","summary":"Synthetic proteins with high affinity and selectivity for a protein target can be used as research tools, biomarkers, and pharmacological agents, but few methods exist to design such proteins de novo.

InSiPS is a genetic algorithm that refines a pool of random sequences over hundreds of generations of mutation and selection to produce SBPs with pre-specified binding characteristics. As a proof of concept, we design SBPs against three yeast proteins and demonstrate binding and functional inhibition of two of three targets in vivo. Peptide SPOT arrays confirm binding sites, and a permutation array demonstrates target specificity.

With the advent of high performance computing and the commensurate increase in available data, the opportunity to capture the overall distribution of values by means of nonparametric curve fitting enables the identification of exceptional points in large datasets. With a rank order structure, these distributions may exhibit a ‚Äúknee‚Äù delineating a threshold between exceptional points and those of the baseline. Given an accurate characterization of the distribution of prediction scores, including careful identification of the knee, we have previously shown that predictive performance can be significantly improved by leveraging this ‚Äúcontext‚Äù. This paper examines the nonparametric characterization of such distributions. Locally weighted regression (LOESS) is a widely used nonparametric approach to curve fitting. Here, we revisit the assumptions behind the selection of kernel functions for nonparametric curve fitting of biological and biomedical data exhibiting rare or exceptional instances. We propose a new linear asymmetric kernel function and compare it to the commonly used tricube kernel used in LOESS. We evaluate its ability to fit rank order data in the domain of protein-protein interaction prediction. The proposed linear kernel significantly improved predictive performance ) of two state-of-the-art predictors and promises to be widely applicable in related machine learning pipelines and nonparametric regression tasks.","tags":null,"title":"Fitting rank order data in the age of context","type":"publication"},{"authors":null,"categories":null,"content":"Presentation slide are available here.\n","date":1543881600,"expirydate":-62135596800,"kind":"page","lang":"en","lastmod":1543881600,"objectID":"721a4894e53e218b7221729aa32cd9cc","permalink":"https://kevindick.ai/talk/aafc-diirectorate/","publishdate":"2018-12-04T00:00:00Z","relpermalink":"/talk/aafc-diirectorate/","section":"talk","summary":"Described the history of classical and contemporary AI/ML methods.

Historically, a single global threshold, typically optimized via cross-validation testing, is applied to all protein pairs. However, we here use data visualization techniques to show that no single decision threshold is suitable for all protein pairs, given the inherent diversity of protein interaction profiles. The recent development of high throughput PPI predictors has enabled the comprehensive scoring of all possible protein-protein pairs. This, in turn, has given rise to context, enabling us now to evaluate a PPI within the context of all possible predictions. Leveraging this context, we introduce a novel modeling framework called Reciprocal Perspective (RP), which estimates a localized threshold on a per-protein basis using several rank order metrics. By considering a putative PPI from the perspective of each of the proteins within the pair, RP rescores the predicted PPI and applies a cascaded Random Forest classifier leading to improvements in recall and precision. We here validate RP using two state-of-the-art PPI predictors, the Protein-protein Interaction Prediction Engine and the Scoring PRotein INTeractions methods, over five organisms: Homo sapiens, Saccharomyces cerevisiae, Arabidopsis thaliana, Caenorhabditis elegans, and Mus musculus. Results demonstrate the application of a post hoc RP rescoring layer significantly improves classification (p‚Äâ","tags":null,"title":"Reciprocal perspective for improved protein-protein interaction prediction","type":"publication"},{"authors":["Mohamed Hozayen","Shermeen Nizami","Amente Bekele","Kevin Dick","James Green"],"categories":null,"content":"","date":1527811200,"expirydate":-62135596800,"kind":"page","lang":"en","lastmod":1527811200,"objectID":"c5fba2a9dca6307d8240b57138393fa9","permalink":"https://kevindick.ai/publication/hozayen-2018-developing/","publishdate":"2018-06-01T00:00:00Z","relpermalink":"/publication/hozayen-2018-developing/","section":"publication","summary":"This paper develops platform agnostic, user-friendly, open source software applications Patient Monitor Data Importer (PMDI) and parserPMDI to import physiologic data from patient monitors in real-time. These applications form part of a larger research project that is investigating the novel use of the pressure-sensitive mat (PSM) technology for continuous patient monitoring in the neonatal intensive care unit (NICU). To evaluate the potential for PSM for respiration and patient movement detection, gold standard physiologic data are required. This research is being conducted at the Children‚Äôs Hospital of Eastern Ontario (CHEO), Ottawa, Canada, where physiologic data are acquired using the Infinity Delta patient monitor series (Dr√§ger Medical, Germany). Currently, one must purchase proprietary data logging software to acquire data from these monitors. The PMDI and parserPMDI have been developed as open source applications in our lab to (a) import multiple physiologic data streams from patient monitors; (b) import alarm data associated with each physiologic data stream; (c) display data parameters and acquisition status in a graphical user interface; (d) export the data in decimal format to a CSV file; (e) be robust to temporary cable disconnections; and (f) facilitate data logging from a variety of patient monitors through modular expansion of the open source code. These interoperable applications programmed in Java communicate with the monitor to import physiologic data in hexadecimal messages. The message is then parsed into a decimal table and stored as a CSV file. Currently, these two applications enable researchers to collect and parse physiologic data from the Dr√§ger Infinity Delta patient monitors. However, their modular design facilitates retargeting to import data from monitoring equipment from other vendors. The current PMDI imports and parses discrete parameters such as heart and pulse rates and discrete alarm events. The Java application source code has been released as open source enabling other researchers to use them for real-time patient data acquisition and analysis.","tags":null,"title":"Developing a Real-Time Patient Monitor Data Import System","type":"publication"},{"authors":["Tom Kazmirchuk","Kevin Dick","Daniel J Burnside","Brad Barnes","Houman Moteshareie","Maryam Hajikarimlou","Katayoun Omidi","Duale Ahmed","Andrew Low","Clara Lettl"," others"],"categories":null,"content":"","date":1509580800,"expirydate":-62135596800,"kind":"page","lang":"en","lastmod":1509580800,"objectID":"6aa1b94d14ceb7a367f7e4793e3f38b8","permalink":"https://kevindick.ai/publication/kazmirchuk-2017-designing/","publishdate":"2017-11-02T00:00:00Z","relpermalink":"/publication/kazmirchuk-2017-designing/","section":"publication","summary":"The production of anti-Zika virus (ZIKV) therapeutics has become increasingly important as the propagation of the devastating virus continues largely unchecked. Notably, a causal relationship between ZIKV infection and neurodevelopmental abnormalities has been widely reported, yet a specific mechanism underlying impaired neurological development has not been identified. Here, we report on the design of several synthetic competitive inhibitory peptides against key pathogenic ZIKV proteins through the prediction of protein‚Äìprotein interactions (PPIs). Often, PPIs between host and viral proteins are crucial for infection and pathogenesis, making them attractive targets for therapeutics. Using two complementary sequence-based PPI prediction tools, we first produced a comprehensive map of predicted human-ZIKV PPIs (involving 209 human protein candidates). We then designed several peptides intended to disrupt the corresponding host-pathogen interactions thereby acting as anti-ZIKV therapeutics. The data generated in this study constitute a foundational resource to aid in the multi-disciplinary effort to combat ZIKV infection, including the design of additional synthetic proteins.","tags":null,"title":"Designing anti-Zika virus peptides derived from predicted human-Zika virus protein-protein interactions","type":"publication"},{"authors":["Kevin Dick","Frank Dehne","Ashkan Golshani","James R Green"],"categories":null,"content":"","date":1508198400,"expirydate":-62135596800,"kind":"page","lang":"en","lastmod":1508198400,"objectID":"f217b1608bbdb279b543f0ec5f32420f","permalink":"https://kevindick.ai/publication/dick-2017-positome/","publishdate":"2017-10-17T00:00:00Z","relpermalink":"/publication/dick-2017-positome/","section":"publication","summary":"The progressive elucidation of positive protein-protein interactions (PPIs) as wet-lab techniques continue to improve in both throughput and precision has increased the number and quality of known PPIs across the spectrum of life. Creating high quality datasets of positive PPIs is critical for training PPI prediction algorithms and for assessing the performance of PPI detection efforts. We present the Positome, a web service to acquire sets of positive PPIs based on user-defined criteria pertaining to data provenance including interaction type, throughput level, and detection method selection in addition to filtration by multiple lines of evidence (i.e. PPIs reported by independent research groups). The Positome provides a tunable interface to obtain a specified subset of interacting PPIs from the BioGRlD database. Both intra- and inter-species PPIs are supported. Using a number of model organisms, we demonstrate the trade-off between data quality and quantity, and the benefit of higher data quality on PPI prediction precision and recall.

Vaccinations have numerous health benefits for immunized individuals as well as for the general public through herd immunity. Given the rise in immunization-preventable diseases, a consequence of people opting out of their routine vaccinations, we determined that Canadian health data can identify individuals over the age of 60 who chose not to get vaccinated (80.1% negative predictive value) and individuals under the age of 60 who have recently been vaccinated (96.4% positive predictive value). Using the 2009-2014 Canadian Community Health Surveys (CCHS), a probit model identified the variables that were most commonly associated with flu vaccination outcomes. Of 1,381 variables, 47 with the most significant marginal effects were selected, including the presence of diseases (e.g. diabetes and cancer), behavioral characteristics (e.g. smoking and exercise), exposure to the medical system (e.g. whether the individual gets a regular check-up), and a person's living situation (e.g. having young children in the household). These variables were then used to generate a Random Forest classification model, trained on the 2009-2013 dataset, and tested on the 2014 dataset. We achieved an overall accuracy of 87.8% between the two final models, each using 25 classification trees with bounded depth of 20 nodes, randomly selecting from all 47 variables. With the two proposed policies, this model can be leveraged to efficiently allocate vaccination promotion efforts. Additionally, it can be applied to future surveys, only requiring 3.6% of the variables in the CCHS for successful prediction.","tags":null,"title":"Identifying Unvaccinated Individuals in Canada: A Predictive Model","type":"publication"},{"authors":["Kevin Dick","James Green"],"categories":null,"content":"","date":1468195200,"expirydate":-62135596800,"kind":"page","lang":"en","lastmod":1468195200,"objectID":"88ff614c5c40e52bb611a2f9bc2e30b4","permalink":"https://kevindick.ai/publication/dick-2016-comparison/","publishdate":"2016-07-11T00:00:00Z","relpermalink":"/publication/dick-2016-comparison/","section":"publication","summary":"Computational protein-protein interaction (PPI) prediction is a diverse field with multiple paradigms generating insightful interaction interface information.
